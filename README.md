# git-crawler

This project was created with the intention of
discovering what keys are most common in programming language
code files.

At first, it was just the occurences that were tracked,
and those database files can be located in the `/archive` folder.

Now, the code has been modified to track the `WINDOW_SIZE` previous
characters that occured as well.

Ultimately, the goal of this is to help create an optimized
keyboard layout for programming.
