          <p>This project was created with the intention of
          discovering what keys are most common in programming language
          code files.</p>
          <p>At first, it was just the occurences that were tracked,
          and those database files can be located in the <code>/archive</code> folder.</p>
          <p>Now, the code has been modified to track the <code>WINDOW_SIZE</code> previous
          characters that occured as well.
          The current iteration of the database that is tracked utilizes a <code>WINDOW_SIZE</code>
          of 3. Thus it tracks the current character, and the three proceeding characters as well.
          </p>
          <p>Ultimately, the goal of this is to help create an optimized
          keyboard layout for programming.</p>
